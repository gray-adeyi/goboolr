# GOBOOLR

GOBOOLR is my second attempt to rewriting [BOOLR](https://github.com/GGBRW/BOOLR) a digital simulator built with electron and vanilla js.
The goal of this project is a daring attempt to improve my frontend knowledge and desire to keep the
[BOOLR](http://boolr.me/) project up to date because I think it's really cool. GOBOOLR is built using [Wails](https://wails.io/), Vue + Typescript.
