# GOBOOLR

GOBOOLR is my second attempt to rewriting BOOLR a digital simulator built with electron and vanilla js.
The goal of this project is a daring attempt to improve my frontend knowledge and desire to keep the
BOOLR project up to date because I think it's really cool. GOBOOLR is built using Wails, Vue + Typescript.
